# Circuit-for-charging-battery
First, I used the Tinkercad website.

Second, I used the required elements, which are as follows:

9 volt battery

Multimeter

The Breadboard small

5V Regulator 

Two polarized Capastors

Then I connected the circuit as shown in the picture.

I used the 5V Regulator to regulate the voltage just 5V
and I used Capastors for save the power if the battery has problem or dead to charge again
